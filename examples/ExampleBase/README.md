# Example Base

To demonstrate an application, there should be certain interaction with the demonstrator. The interface in between could be quite simple or have widgets commonly used. This project provides a collection of flavored applications composed of straightforward interface, and also shows codes for easy reference so that developers can save their time starting off from scratch.

## Flavors
 - __Btn2__ : Compose views with 2 buttons
 - __Btn4__ : Compose views with 4 buttons
 - __Btn4Et1__ : Compose views with 4 buttons and 1 edit text
 - __Btn5__ : Compose views with 5 buttons
 - __Dyn__ : Compose views dynamically for quick addition
 - __IconBtn8__ : Compose views with 8 icon buttons
 - __SimpDyn__ : Compose views dynamically (more simple than Dyn flavor)
 - __Term__ : Compose views in terminal style
