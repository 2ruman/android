# Example Base

To demonstrate an application, there should be certain interaction with the demonstrator. The interface in between could be quite simple or mostly have widgets commonly used. This project provides developers with a collection of flavored applications which are composed of straightforward views, and also shows codes and resources for easy reference so that developers can save their time starting off a new project from scratch.
